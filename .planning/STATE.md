# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-08)

**Core value:** Dispatcher always knows where every truck is, what it's carrying, and how much it has spent — and can assign a new trip before the truck returns
**Current focus:** Phase 1: Infrastructure & Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 5 (Infrastructure & Foundation)
Plan: 3 of 6 in current phase
Status: Executing
Last activity: 2026-03-09 — Completed plan 03 (persistent=True on all 4 remaining ConversationHandlers)

Progress: [██░░░░░░░░] 10%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 3
- Average duration: 2 min
- Total execution time: 0.1 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-infrastructure-and-foundation | 3/6 | 7 min | 2.3 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (3 min), 01-02 (2 min), 01-03 (2 min)
- Trend: Stable

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Pre-phase]: PicklePersistence for FSM in beta; migrate to PostgreSQL-backed persistence before production
- [Pre-phase]: Fuel anomaly threshold set at 20% over norm (not 10%) to reduce false positives on mountain routes
- [Pre-phase]: APScheduler replaces Celery+Redis to save a Railway service; anomaly checks run hourly in-process
- [Pre-phase]: Alembic migrations run as pre-deploy hook, never inside FastAPI startup event
- [01-01]: async_database_url as @property on Settings converts postgresql:// to postgresql+asyncpg:// transparently for asyncpg driver
- [01-01]: Admin credentials (ADMIN_USERNAME, ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH) in env vars only for Phase 1 — no DB admin table until multi-dispatcher needed
- [01-01]: aiosqlite kept in requirements for local dev SQLite fallback; asyncpg used on Railway with PostgreSQL
- [01-03]: PTB requires both name= AND persistent=True on ConversationHandler; only persistent=True was missing in 4 of 5 handlers — added with no other changes
- [01-03]: FSM persistence now complete across all 5 ConversationHandlers; bot conversation state survives Railway redeployments

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- FX rate source for multi-currency expenses needs a decision before Phase 2 implementation (static table vs live API)
- Photo mandatory vs optional in bot beta — decide before Phase 2 UX is written (2G upload reliability on driver routes)
- Railway plan tier (Hobby vs Pro) should be confirmed before Phase 1 deploy to understand cold-start behavior
